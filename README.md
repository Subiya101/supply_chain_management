# OVERVIEW
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business twoyears back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand andsupply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss ininventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants tooptimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.Create a model using : https://github.com/Subiya101/supply_chain_management/blob/main/supply_train.csv

# GOALS
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine anoptimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.1. Focus on all steps of data science (EDA, data processing, model, evaluation, charts)2. Highlight any trend in data, deep insight, novel steps that you take3. Highlight next steps and improvements.4. Apply 5 to 6 machine learning algorithms and evaluate it using https://github.com/Subiya101/supply_chain_management/blob/main/supply_test.csv.
